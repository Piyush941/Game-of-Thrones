    "Quest Adventure Welcome to Quest Adventure! In this game, you will take on the role of an adventurer who sets out to save the kingdom. You will be presented with various choices at different stages of the quest, and your decisions will determine the outcome of the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stage 1: Introduction You are greeted with a prompt asking for your name. Once you enter your name, you will be told that you are on the edge of a dark forest and asked if you would like to step into the forest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stage 2: Forest If you choose to step into the forest, you will be presented with the option to move in one of four directions: left, right, forward, or backward. Depending on your choice, you may encounter different obstacles or find yourself at different locations in the forest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stage 3: Bear If you choose to move left, you will encounter a bear. This will result in your death and the end of the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stage 4: Deeper into the Forest If you choose to move right, you will continue deeper into the forest. Here, you will be presented with new obstacles and choices that will affect the outcome of your quest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stage 5: Final Stage You have reached the final stage of your quest. In front of you, you see a castle. To your left, there is a moat with a drawbridge. To your right, there is a steep cliff. Behind you, there is a dense forest. If you choose to go left and cross the drawbridge you will enter the castle and complete your quest, if you choose to go right, you will fall to your death, if you choose forward you will go back to the first stage and if you choose backward you will give up on your quest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the game, you will be given feedback on your choices and the outcome of your quest. Be sure to think carefully about each decision you make and good luck on your adventure!"
